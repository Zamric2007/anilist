            <h2>Anime:</h2>
            <p>Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in
                English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. However, in Japan and in Japanese,
                anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works,
                regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are
                also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and artstyles that can be
                considered as "anime".</p>

            <h2>Manga:</h2>
            <p>Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in
                Japan in the late 19th century, and the form has a long history in earlier Japanese art. The term manga
                is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to
                refer to comics originally published in the country.</p>
